= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:


=== /api/v1/cities

.request
include::snippets/cities/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::snippets/cities/http-response.adoc[]

=== /api/v1/city/name

.request
include::snippets/cityname/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::snippets/cityname/http-response.adoc[]

=== /api/v1/city/name/date

.request
include::snippets/citynamedate/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::snippets/citynamedate/http-response.adoc[]

=== /api/v1/logs

.request
include::snippets/logs/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::snippets/logs/http-response.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
